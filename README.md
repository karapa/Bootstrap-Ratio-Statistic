# Bootstrap-Ratio-Statistic

- I use bootstrap to test a hypothesis about a ratio statistic. 
- I provide two alternatives to calculate the same hypothesis. 
- You need the "bootRatio.bib" in your working directory to compile the Rmd file.
- the "bootRatio.bib" " stores the references. If not familiar with Bibtex, just delete the "bibliography: "bootRatio.bib"
from the Rmd preamble (10th line) - it compiles without the citations and refs 
(you can always check the references from the pdf file.)
